              This was my Capstone Project for UW where I worked in a team with Novo Nordisk to
              create an application that displays NN's data associated with obesity health outcomes.
              This display of data is the quantitative insights into the impact of obesity and its
              Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) on their patients' population from a health and
              cost perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this project I was the project manager where I oversaw our progression with our project
              on a weekly basis. In order to aid with this, I created a project plan and a Gantt Chart
              that would be updated weekly based on weekly meetings. I also managed communication with
              NN mentors and UW TA as well as set up meeting plans for our team.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used Python along side Bokeh library to create data visualizations of obesity data
              that is based on the user's query. To create APIs I used Flask API adopting RESTful API
              techniques for the back and front end communication. In the end, our team was in a showcase
              to present our project.
